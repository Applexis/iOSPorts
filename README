iOS Ports
=========

   iOS Ports is a Collection of F/OSS libraries which have been ported to
   the iPhoneOS/iOS platform.  The conditions of the license of each package
   included in iOS Ports are believed to allow for use of each package on
   an iOS device, however a developer should review the license of each
   package before including it within an application and to verify that the
   application meets the requirements of the conditions.
